 Comety toolkit
----------------

*Comety* is a simple toolkit for building web applications that
can promptly react to server-side events using a technique
called Comet_.

Comet_ is a web programming model that allows a web server to
push data to a browser. *Comety* enables the Comet_ model in web
applications that use a multi-threaded server without the
expense of configuring and maintaining complex dependencies such
as *Tornado* or *Twisted*. *Comety* is designed for applications with
small numbers of concurrent users.

About this repository
---------------------

This repository contains the source code of the *Comety toolkit*.
Its top-level components are:

=========================    ===============================================
``comety``                   Python package with the toolkit's common
                             code. Modules from this package can be used by
                             any *Comety* application, regardless of its
                             framework. This does not apply to
                             subpackages, which may be dependent on
                             frameworks.  
``comety/django``            Python package with elements of the toolkit
                             that depend on the Django_ framework. Its
                             contents can be added as an application to a
                             *Django project*.

Using Comety
------------

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Comety* is designed for use in web applications. Modern web applications are
typically built within web frameworks, such as Django_. Core parts of *Comety*,
however, do not depend on Django_, or any other framework. The toolkit's design
allows for adding support of other frameworks in future.

Dependencies listed in the `Core dependencies`_ section below must be met in
all environments that use *Comety*. Dependencies listed in the following
sections apply only to parts of *Comety* built for frameworks specified in
those sections.

Core dependencies

Comety and your application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make *Comety* available to your application, you have to:

#. Comply with the toolkit's license terms. Please review the ``NOTICE``
   file at the root of this repository for licensing information.
#. Place a copy of the ``comety`` directory from this repository, or
   install the toolkit's distribution, on your application's
   ``PYTHONPATH``. 

Please refer to the PyDoc comments within the toolkit's packages for usage
details.

Comety in a Django project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For web applications that use Django_ framework, the toolkit offers a template
that generates a script that receives events in a browser, and a view class
that talks to that script and manages timeouts.

The above facilities can be made available to a Django_ project by adding
``comety.django`` as an application to the project's ``INSTALLED_APPS``
setting and enabling the ``APP_DIRS`` option in the ``TEMPLATES`` setting.
